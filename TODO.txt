- Need to tighten up skos1 so it's only outputting stuff for parameter
	should just be the outer loops that needs more constraint. 

	- although the indirection is difficult. - we have to be able to trace it 
	back. this might be hard.

- need a view to tell us the nesting level of a concept.

- need to verify that we've got 2nd and 3rd tier being outputted correctly

---

Lets have a stab at the other skos. file.
