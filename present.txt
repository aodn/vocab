Problem
select * from responsible_party ;
Table,
select * from organisation;

Views, 
select * from _get_responsible_party  ;

Also, have Skos level views
select * from _skos_concept limit 1 ;
select * from _skos_concept_skos_narrower limit 1 ;

And these are used to generate the files that we input to geonetwork for hierarchical search

And rdf centric
select * from _rdf;

So we need a way to update the tables,

Show As proposed the task was to write sql stored procs, to enable POs to create, (read), update, delete 	
	- especially important,
		- presents a logical object/tuple view, rather than an integer foreign key

	- Show stored proc - these are brittle in their maintenance relative to the underlying .
	- actions are CRUD. what do we use for CRUD - and ORM mapper. 
		
	- so I then started looking at our existing tools - and hibernate, and found a plugin
	to reverse engineer, the db, and create the needed bindings, 
	the result is, that can now drill down, using object like 'dot' notation. 		

grails shell
groovy:000> println vocab.VocabularyTerm.get(1).proposerResponsibleParty.person.name
groovy:000> println vocab.VocabularyTerm.get(1).proposerResponsibleParty.organisation.name

Wrote a bunch of test case/examples,
