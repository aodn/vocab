SKOS ONTOLOGY
	- "The skos ontology defines a Concept class, and preferred labels, 
	alternative labels, and relationships to other concepts are modeled as 
	properties of that class".

	- you assign metadata to the concept. but not to the label. although 
	there is an extension mechanism - SKOS-Xl



http://d2rq.org/

	- The D2RQ Platform is a system for accessing relational databases as virtual, read-only 
	RDF graphs. It offers RDF-based access to the content of relational databases without 
	having to replicate it into an RDF store. Using D2RQ you can:

		- query a non-RDF database using SPARQL
		- access the content of the database as Linked Data over the Web
		- create custom dumps of the database in RDF formats for loading into an RDF store



OCAML-RDF
	Supports postgres !!!

SKOS Core - thesaurus.

SKOS Core[21] defines the classes and properties sufficient to represent the 
common features found in a standard thesaurus. It is based on a concept-centric 
view of the vocabulary, where primitive objects are not terms, but abstract 
notions represented by terms. Each SKOS concept is defined as an RDF resource. 
Each concept can have RDF properties attached, including:

    - one or more preferred index terms (at most one in each natural language)
    - alternative terms or synonyms
    - definitions and notes, with specification of their language

Concepts can be organized in hierarchies using broader-narrower relationships, 
or linked by non-hierarchical (associative) relationships. Concepts can be 
gathered in concept schemes, to provide consistent and structured sets of 
concepts, representing whole or part of a controlled vocabulary.

These features represent the stable part of SKOS Core. Other elements of the 
vocabulary are still considered unstable.[citation needed]


--** SKOS concept - is an RDF resource **--.

Terms(language), (synonyms), definitions and notes.

DATABASE
	triple structure of rdf

ONTOLOGY
OWL = ontology web language
	- relation between classes and super classes 
	and predicates relations are called an 'ontology'.

	'Nothing magical about semtantics and Ontologies'

	- "a bit like database schemas"





CLASSES (for object/subjects)
	- have inheritance

	- eg super  
		foaf_person -> agent	
		image -> document	


RESOURCE
	- R in RDF
	- the triple - object, predicate, subject.

SISSVOC and ANDS

The different configurations of interest are the SISSVoc instances that are operational at 
	ANDS (http://www.ands.org.au/services/controlled-vocabulary.html 
		and http://researchdata.ands.org.au/developers/documentation/services/vocabulary_api) 
		and within eReefs (https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/Siss/SISSvoc3Overview 
		and https://wiki.csiro.au/display/ER/Water+Quality+vocabulary) 
		
	and the LDP as described at https://github.com/UKGovLD/ukl-registry-poc/wiki (prototype deployment at http://environment.data.gov.uk/registry/).


ANDS
	- australian national data service
	- http://www.ands.org.au/services/controlled-vocabulary.html

	- At this point in time, no automated interface between the catalogue and server exists. 

	IMPORTANT - ANDS intends to 
	Vocabularies published through the catalogue are not automatically available via the server. 
	This will be addressed in a coming release of the service.

	Endpoint

	Why not get ANDS front end?

SISSVOC
	- SISS = spatial information services stack.


	 Kim - 

	The wording of the brief in trying to summarise the task in one sentence to 
	begin with is probably a little misleading. We already know (I think) that 
	
	SISSVoc out of the box has *not* been designed as an authoring and vocab 
	management tool, but rather a publishing and retrieval tool, so before 
	commencing an evaluation on that product we know most of the evaluation will 
	end up focussing on the ‘publishing and retrieval' aspects. 


	SISSVoc: A Linked Data API for SKOS vocabularies
	

LDP

	LDP by contrast looks like it has authoring and management capability in addition 
	to publishing capability. Anyway, I think you are correct. The evaluation should be 
	covering term authoring and management which was alluded to in the expansion on the 
	‘purpose’ in part (a) of Roger’s brief by including 'maintaining and 
	populating' the different platforms. But it wasn't clear enough.

REIFICATION
	- The body of knowledge modeled by a collection of statements may be subjected to 
	reification, in which each statement (that is each triple 
	subject-predicate-object altogether) is assigned a URI and treated as a 
	resource about which additional statements can be made, as in "Jane says that 
	John is the author of document X". Reification is sometimes important in order 
	to deduce a level of confidence or degree of usefulness for each statement.

	- In a reified RDF database, each original statement, being a resource, itself, 
	most likely has at least three additional statements made about it: one to 
	assert that its subject is some resource, one to assert that its predicate is 
	some resource, and one to assert that its object is some resource or literal. 
	More statements about the original statement may also exist, depending on the 
	application's needs.

SENSORML 
	- SensorML is an approved Open Geospatial Consortium standard. 
	- SensorML provides standard models and an XML encoding for describing sensors and 
	measurement processes.
	- generic but considered robust.
	- SensorML can provide a complete and unambiguous description of the 
	lineage of an observation. In other words, it can describe in detail the 
	process by which an observation came to be .... from acquisition by one or more 
	detectors to processing and perhaps even interpretation by an analyst.

CSW - search interface - can be used as search interface over 19135


Geonetwork - search to 19135 - is just geonetwork UI search. 



SOS - Sensor Observation Service
	- The Sensor Observation Service (SOS) is a web service to query real-time sensor 
	data and sensor data time series and is part of the Sensor Web. 

	- the SOS is an official OGC standard. 
	- modeled in sensorml

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_Observation_Service


ISO 19135 - 
	specifies procedures to be followed in establishing, maintaining and

	- does this mean web-services for publishing terms?.

	- change of terms over time. dealt with expressly. 
	- independent of technology

LINKED DATA
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data

	method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and 
	become more useful. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF 
	and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it 
	extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by 
	computers.

TRIPLE STORE DATABASE

	- A triplestore is a purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of 
	triples,[1] a triple being a data entity composed of subject-predicate-object, 
	like "Bob is 35" or "Bob knows Fred".

	Much like a relational database, one stores information in a triplestore and 
	retrieves it via a query language. Unlike a relational database, a triplestore 
	is optimized for the storage and retrieval of triples. In addition to queries, 
	triples can usually be imported/exported using Resource Description Framework 
	(RDF) and other formats.

SWISH
	Interesting
	Swish is a framework, written in the purely functional programming language 
	Haskell, for performing deductions in RDF data using a variety of techniques.

SKOS 
	- Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is a W3C recommendation 
	designed for representation of thesauri, classification schemes, taxonomies, 
	subject-heading systems, 
		or any other type of structured controlled vocabulary.
		- SKOS is part of the Semantic Web family of standards built upon RDF 
	and RDFS, and its main objective is to enable easy publication and use of such 
	vocabularies as linked data.
		- This mechanism for describing resources is a major component in the 
	W3C's Semantic Web activity:


RDFS = RDF schema


SPARQL.
	- inference language to work with rdf 

	Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language

RDF
	- core concept - is tripple =  subject, predicate, object

	- Includes Dublin core.

	- The resource "http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me" is the subject.
	The objects are:
		"Eric Miller" (with a predicate "whose name is"),
		mailto:e.miller123(at)example (with a predicate "whose email address is"), and
		"Dr." (with a predicate "whose title is").


		- The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a family of World Wide 
	Web Consortium (W3C) specifications [1] originally designed as a metadata data 
	model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or 
	modeling of information that is implemented in web resources, using a variety 
	of syntax notations and data serialization formats.

		subject / predicate
		based upon the idea of making statements about resources (in particular 
	web resources) in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions.

		 These expressions are known as triples in RDF terminology. The subject 
	denotes the resource, and the predicate denotes traits or aspects of the 
	resource and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object. For 
	example, one way to represent the notion "The sky has the color blue" in RDF is 
	as the triple: a subject denoting "the sky", a predicate denoting "has", and an 
	object denoting "the color blue". 

	A collection of RDF statements intrinsically represents a labeled, directed 
	multi-graph. As such, an RDF-based data model is more naturally suited to 
	certain kinds of knowledge representation than the relational model and other 
	ontological models.  
	--

	- The root RDF data model is deliberately very minimal and, as with 
	XML, that minimalism is intended to make things easier for programs. 

	- One consequence of that minimalism, when coupled with other 
	machine-friendly design tropes, is that though "human readable", RDF is not 
	generally very human writable (although the Notation3 syntax tries to improve 
	things.) 

	- Furthermore, while RDF's data model is specified, the processing 
	model isn't (deliberately), so one should expect a wide variety of processors, 
	each working in its own way, depending on a variety of constraints and 
	desiderata.

CONTOLLED VOCABULARY
	- 
	Controlled vocabularies provide a way to organize knowledge for 
	subsequent retrieval. They are used in subject indexing schemes, subject 
	headings, thesauri, etc 

	Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate predefined, authorised terms 
	preselected by the designer of the vocabulary, in contrast to natural language 
	vocabularies without restriction.

RDF query language  / SPARQL
	- specifically a query language for databases, able to retrieve and 
	manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework format.
	- SPARQL is emerging as the de facto RDF query language

	SPARQL allows for a query to consist of triple patterns, conjunctions, 
	disjunctions, and optional patterns.[7]
