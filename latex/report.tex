\section{High level requirements}

\subsection{Resolvable content should be structured (or at least be able to be queried)
  using an RDF/SKOS encoding model. Content may however be adorned by other
  languages/metadata models (e.g. RDFS, OWL, Dublin Core).  }


	SISSVoc provides a linked data API for publishing SKOS vocabularies.
  SKOS provides a standard vocabulary for thesarui, classifications, taxonomies
  and controlled vocabularies using RDF.
   According to Cox, SKOS lacks the expresitivity of languages such as OWL.
  However common metadata standards like Dublin Core are supported.
    It is anticipated that SKOS can be decorated with any data/metadata that can
  be encoded in RDF triples.

	Additionally the SKOS Extensions RDF Vocabulary are a set of terms extending
	the SKOS Core vocabulary to support some common features of knowledge
	organisation systems, especially thesauri. (link) The extensions would appear
	to be designed to cover common needs for representing authoring and publishing.

	Resolvable content - can be extracted SKOS Concepts from the already developed
	relational vocab database demonstrates another approach which can then be
	ingested to a RDF persistence. An example script has been created to demonstate
	the feasibility of this approach. Alternately a SPARQL interface to RDF could
	be used over the db, to form RDF/SKOS content.

\LaTeX{} is a document preparation system for the \TeX{}
  typesetting program. It offers programmable desktop
  publishing features and extensive facilities for
  automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop
  publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing,
  tables and figures, page layout, bibliographies, and
  much more. \LaTeX{} was originally written in 1984 by
  Leslie Lamport and has become the dominant method for
  using \TeX; few people write in plain \TeX{} anymore.
  The current version is \LaTeXe.
