   Main function is to provide a resolvable endpoint for a vocabulary and its

  In the SISSVOC paper \footnote{
  See Table 6, SISSVoc: A Linked Data API for SKOS vocabularies.

  SiSSVoc - locally or externally hosted (ANDS) supports using persistent
  identifiers.  Article tals branding. 4 things - expected.  Talk about rdf.

  SiSSVOC is built upon rdf, and is a restful publishing api. 

      Cox states, that SISSVoc supports, For each item in the vocabulary, HTTP GET
  {URI} should resolve to a description of the item. This is suitable for direct
  reference to vocabulary items, and in-line links within datasets.

  The DNS resolvable component of the uri, it is expected that ANDs will maintain
  . 


  ANDS and IMOS has extensive experience in managing in chef the DNS component of
  names. Alternatively ANDS






\subsection{Resolvable content should be structured (or at least be able to be queried)
  using an RDF/SKOS encoding model. Content may however be adorned by other
  languages/metadata models (e.g. RDFS, OWL, Dublin Core).* }

  SISSVoc API - is orientated around Concept, Collection and .

  It's assumed that being decorated with other RDF content.
  

	SISSVoc provides a linked data API for publishing SKOS vocabularies.
  SKOS provides a standard vocabulary for thesarui, classifications, taxonomies
  and controlled vocabularies using RDF.
   According to Cox, SKOS lacks the expresitivity of languages such as OWL.
  However common metadata standards like Dublin Core are supported.
    It is anticipated that SKOS can be decorated with any data/metadata that can
  be encoded in RDF triples.


	Additionally the SKOS Extensions RDF Vocabulary are a set of terms extending
	the SKOS Core vocabulary to support some common features of knowledge
	organisation systems, especially thesauri. (link) The extensions would appear
	to be designed to cover common needs for representing authoring and publishing.

	Resolvable content - can be extracted SKOS Concepts from the already developed
	relational vocab database demonstrates another approach which can then be
	ingested to a RDF persistence. An example script has been created to demonstate
	the feasibility of this approach. Alternately a SPARQL interface to RDF could
	be used over the , to form RDF/SKOS content.

  \begin{italicquotes} 
  It should be possible to access vocabularies and their terms via an 
  (administratively) customisable Web-client interface and service interfaces.*

  \end{italicquotes} 

  - still waiting on ANDS to give a test account.

  - need to mention the handbook.

  SiSSVoc as a standalone application does not support for creation and update
  of vocabulary terms.  - since it is implemented on top of a read-only SPARQL
  endpoint/interface.  According to the ANDS handbackâ€¦ has extended SISSVOC, with
  a web supporting the editing SKOS files at file level - presumably by
  interacting with the file-store. Some support for web-based versioning and
  author management is available. There is a potential for conflict with the
  \texttt{control\_vocab\_db}. And a question. if we maintain current db.

  SiSSVoc running as a local instance supports customisation, image branding
changes can be achieved and examples are given using simple css configuration.
Examples are given in the source example.

  SISSVOC advice using a an external vocabulary content maintained using rdf
editors (such as Protege or TopBraid Composer ). which ensure consistency of
relationships between resources is maintained. And then generate the rdf files. 

  For web-based - maintenance environment - Enterprise Vocabulary NET and
PoolParty Thesaurus Server.

\LaTeX{} is a document preparation system for the \TeX{}
  typesetting program. It offers programmable desktop
  publishing features and extensive facilities for
  automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop
  publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing,
  tables and figures, page layout, bibliographies, and
  much more. \LaTeX{} was originally written in 1984 by
  Leslie Lamport and has become the dominant method for
  using \TeX; few people write in plain \TeX{} anymore.
  The current version is \LaTeXe.
