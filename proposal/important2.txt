Very important. 

	For complex ontology development - a third party tool is needed.

	This is different from registry (LDP), publications (sissvoc), 

SIZE number of resources
	If a database is large, it is not practical to convert those data to 
	static documents, nor is it practical for a consuming application to receive 
	those data in the form of XML documents which must be parsed. T



COULD USE PURL

http://purl.org/docs/index.html

	- PURLs (Persistent Uniform Resource Locators) are Web addresses that 
	act as permanent identifiers in the face of a dynamic and changing Web 
	infrastructure. Instead of resolving directly to Web resources, PURLs provide a 
	level of indirection that allows the underlying Web addresses of resources to 
	change over time without negatively affecting systems that depend on them. This 
	capability provides continuity of references to network resources that may 
	migrate from machine to machine for business, social or technical reasons.

- used to reference DC terms

WHAT DOES SPARQL RETURN ? - XML

Does sparql follow uri's outside it's own domain ?

SISSVOC

a local instance can reference and support multiple vocabulary sources through configuration of different sparql endpoints.

- How does the sparql interface work in sissvoc. 

	- what is it connecting too? 
	elda over files. 
	where are the vocab files?

	- can we use it.
